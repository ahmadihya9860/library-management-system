A simple yet effective Library Management System built with Python, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project allows users to manage books, users, and borrowing activities in a console-based environment.

## üìñ Overview

This project simulates a basic library system where users can add books, register users, borrow and return books, and view library information. It's designed as an educational tool to practice OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

### Key Features
- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and display books with details like title, author, and quantity.
- **User Management**: Register users and track their borrowing history.
- **Borrowing System**: Borrow and return books with validation for availability and limits.
- **Console Interface**: Easy-to-use text-based interface for all operations.
- **Data Persistence**: (Optional: Can be extended with database integration for real-world use.)

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahmadihya9860/library-management-system.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```
   cd library-management-system
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

No additional dependencies are required for the basic version. For advanced features (e.g., database), install required packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided).

## üìã Usage

After running the application, follow the on-screen prompts to:
- Add books to the library.
- Register new users.
- Borrow or return books.
- View library statistics.

### Example Workflow
1. Start the program.
2. Choose to add a book (e.g., Title: "1984", Author: "George Orwell", Quantity: 5).
3. Register a user (e.g., Name: "John Doe").
4. Borrow a book for the user.
5. Return the book when done.
