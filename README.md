## Examining project details  
- The task is to design an optimal README.md for a GitHub project called OOP Store Project.  
- This project is a simple Python application implementing OOP concepts for a store with products.

## Examining project details  
- The project's description is currently in Arabic, but README.

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A simple project to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python. This project simulates a basic store with products that can be added, displayed, and purchased.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Idea

This project mimics a simple store containing products that can be added, displayed, and bought. The project is built entirely without graphical user interfaces, focusing on core OOP concepts such as:

- Creating Classes
- Attributes (Properties)
- Methods (Functions)
- Creating Objects
- Object Interactions

## ðŸ§© Project Components

### ðŸ”¹ product.py

Contains the `Product` class, which represents a product with attributes like:

- Name
- Price
- Quantity

It provides methods such as:

- `show_info()`: To display product information
- `buy()`: To simulate a purchase

### ðŸ”¹ store.py

Contains the `Store` class, which represents the store with attributes like:

- Name
- List of products

It provides methods such as:

- `add_product()`: To add a product
- `show_products()`: To display all products

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your device (version 3.8 or higher).
2. Clone the project or download it:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahmadihya9860/oop_store_project.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd oop_store_project
   ```
4. Run the main file (assuming there's a `main.py` or similar; adjust as needed):
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## ðŸ“ Project Structure

```
oop_store_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ product.py          # Product class
â”œâ”€â”€ store.py            # Store class
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # Main script to run the project
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE             # License file (if applicable)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the classes:

```python
from product import Product
from store import Store

# Create products
product1 = Product("Laptop", 1000, 5)
product2 = Product("Mouse", 20, 10)

# Create a store
store = Store("Tech Store")

# Add products to the store
store.add_product(product1)
store.add_product(product2)

# Display all products
store.show_products()

# Simulate a purchase
product1.buy(2)
```
